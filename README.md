## Collection Analysis Notebooks

A couple of notebooks University of Melboure Archives have used to analyse born digital archives.
Uses checksums and metadata from bagit packages and droid csv files to plot some whole of collection stats.
Also contains a handy corpus of de-identified, contentless bagit packages and droid csv files so you can try at home (or in browser via Binder).
